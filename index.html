    <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
    <h2>The Prologue</h2>
    <h3>Enter Chorus</h3>
    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity</p>
    <p>(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),</p>
    <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
    <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
    <p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
    <p>A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;</p>
    <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
    <p>Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
    <p>The fearful passage of their death-marked love</p>
    <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
    <p>Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,</p>
    <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
    <p>The which, if you with patient ears attend,</p>
    <p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>
